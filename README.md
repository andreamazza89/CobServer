# CobServer

A very simple application to satisfy requirements set out in acceptance tests for a challenge set as part of my apprenticeship
at [8thLight](https://8thlight.com/). This makes it more useful at being an example on how to use my [HTTP Server](https://github.com/andreamazza89/HTTPServer)
than anything else.

To run, compile it with `mvn package`, then `java -jar PATH_TO_JAR_WITH_DEPENDENCIES -p PORT_NUMBER -d PATH_TO_PUBLIC_DIRECTORY`
